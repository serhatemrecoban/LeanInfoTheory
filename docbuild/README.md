# LeanInfoTheory documentation build

This nested Lake project keeps `doc-gen4` out of LeanInfoTheory's runtime
dependency graph. It duplicates the root's fixed Lean `v4.33.1` toolchain pin
and uses the same frozen mathlib release environment. Doc-gen4 is pinned at
`v4.33.1`, commit `e2af49a7b7e5e1a9224008c1f15e7aa4f58a4015`, with all
transitive Git dependencies locked by the nested manifest.

Run the maintained build and coverage check from the repository root:

```powershell
python scripts/validate_release.py api-docs
```

That command explicitly uses local `file:` source links unless `DOCGEN_SRC` is
set to `github`. GitHub mode is accepted only for a clean checkout and produces
exact-commit links; local file-linked output is not a publication artifact.
Generated files live under `docbuild/.lake/build/doc` and are intentionally
untracked. See [`docs/api-documentation.md`](../docs/api-documentation.md) for
the full build, validation, serving, and publication-boundary contract.

This command is the explicit release/milestone gate. The routine
`python scripts/validate_release.py` suite and ordinary push/pull-request CI do
not run it. A manual workflow dispatch can opt into the separate `api_docs`
GitHub-mode job after the routine gates.

On Windows, set `LEANINFOTHEORY_ZIG` to the `zig.exe` from the pinned official
Zig 0.16.0 x86_64 archive. The validator requires SHA-256
`086ce9d47ba42f33a514e1a6e04eb1d4a8fa1d75e0868e0213caad447c91e864`
for the executable and compiles the small project-authored `CCShim.lean`
forwarding executable directly with the pinned Lean toolchain. Linux uses a
system `cc`; downstream library users need neither compiler setup.

The maintained documentation build disables doc-gen4's optional equation
extraction and validates that the database contains zero equation rows.
Rendered declaration names, headers, types, documentation, and source links are
unaffected. The checked local result covers 31 supported module pages, all 601
supported declarations, 92 canonical export targets, and all 13 non-stable
exclusions. Generated types document the current tree; they are not committed
signature fingerprints.
