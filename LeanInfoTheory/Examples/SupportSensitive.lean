# Support-sensitive finite information examples

This opt-in module exercises the support-aware contracts in the finite Shannon
API. The examples distinguish ambient alphabets from PMF support, support-wise
from global functional dependence and injectivity, null from positive
conditioning fibers, and ordinary information loss from recovery using side
information.
