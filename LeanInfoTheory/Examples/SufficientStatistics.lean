# Sufficient-statistics examples

This module gives compact finite examples for the principal sufficiency APIs:
fixed-prior and model-family characterizations, exact recovery, finite
Fisher-Neyman factorization, and KL-divergence preservation. It also records
two failure modes: a constant statistic that loses parameter information and a
channel that recovers only a marginal rather than the required complete law.
