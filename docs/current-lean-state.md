# Current Lean State

Last checkpoint: July 8, 2026, on local commit `63ec77b`.

This is a handoff note for future Lean-focused work. It summarizes the current
architecture and the next useful Lean tasks without changing theorem
statements.

## Current Lean Architecture

- `LeanInfoTheory.lean` is the lightweight root import. It imports the stable
  finite information-measure API and the core certificate/checker definitions,
  but not heavier theorem, semantic bridge, demo, coding, or reference modules.
- `LeanInfoTheory.Basic` holds lightweight namespace/status vocabulary.
- `LeanInfoTheory.Probability.Finite` contains reusable finite `PMF` helper
  lemmas, including real-mass facts and pointwise `PMF.map` formulas.
- `LeanInfoTheory.Shannon.Entropy` defines finite Shannon entropy in nats using
  mathlib `PMF`s and `Real.negMulLog`.
- `LeanInfoTheory.Shannon.InfoMeasures` defines finite marginal laws,
  conditional entropy, mutual information, conditional mutual information, and
  random-variable versions via `PMF.map`.
- `LeanInfoTheory.Shannon.EntropyBounds` is separately importable and contains
  the Jensen-based finite entropy upper bound and the uniform-law equality
  theorem.
- `LeanInfoTheory.Shannon.SemanticBridge` and its subfiles are the heavier
  bridge layer connecting the finite Shannon API to `PMF.toMeasure`, product
  measures, conditional laws, and `InformationTheory.klDiv`.
- `LeanInfoTheory.EntropyExpr`, `LeanInfoTheory.EntropyVal`, and
  `LeanInfoTheory.PrimitiveIneq` form the abstract entropy-expression and
  primitive Shannon inequality layer.
- `LeanInfoTheory.Certificate` and `LeanInfoTheory.Certificate.Checked` contain
  the checked certificate skeleton and raw-to-checked validation path.
- `LeanInfoTheory.Certificate.Submodularity` and `LeanInfoTheory.Examples` are
  separately importable demonstration modules.
- `LeanInfoTheory.MathlibFragments` is a separately importable anchor/checklist
  for mathlib APIs that the project expects to use later.

## Finite Shannon Layer Status

The finite Shannon layer is PMF-based and uses real-valued entropy in nats.

Implemented and building:

- finite entropy `Shannon.entropy`;
- entropy as a finite sum of `Real.negMulLog` terms;
- entropy nonnegativity;
- deterministic-law entropy `H(delta_a) = 0`;
- entropy of random variables via pushforward laws;
- joint entropy as entropy of a joint `PMF`;
- invariance under equivalences, injective relabelings, coordinate swaps, and
  product reassociation;
- marginal laws for pairs and triples, with pointwise mass formulas and
  domination/zero-mass helper lemmas;
- finite conditional entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual
  information as entropy identities;
- Jensen-based bound `H(P) <= log |alpha|` for nonempty finite alphabets;
- uniform-law equality case for the entropy upper bound.

The layer intentionally does not introduce a project-local probability type.
It should continue to reuse mathlib `PMF`, `PMF.map`, `PMF.bind`,
`PMF.toMeasure`, `Real.negMulLog`, and measure-theoretic information theory
where possible.

## Semantic Bridge Status

The semantic bridge is separated from the lightweight finite Shannon files so
that KL divergence, measure products, kernels, and conditional probability
imports do not become root-import dependencies.

Implemented and building:

- `Shannon.selfInfo p a`, with zero-mass convention;
- finite entropy as expected self-information over `PMF.toMeasure`;
- independent product PMF `indepProd`, including support, marginal, and
  product-measure bridge lemmas;
- absolute-continuity helpers from a joint finite law to the product of its
  marginals;
- finite log-ratio formulas for mutual information;
- mutual information as KL divergence from the joint law to the independent
  product law and to the product of marginal measures;
- finite conditional laws `P_{A | B=b}` for nonzero-marginal fibers, with
  factorization lemmas;
- conditional entropy as `sum_b P_B(b) H(P_{A | B=b})`;
- conditional mutual information as averaged fiber mutual information;
- conditional mutual information as averaged fiber KL divergence;
- semantic nonnegativity of mutual information and conditional mutual
  information;
- first mutual-information chain rule:
  `I(A; B, C) = I(A; C) + I(A; B | C)`.

The semantic bridge API is useful but still young. Public aliases for theorem
names should wait until more chain rules, symmetry variants, and downstream
examples reveal the most natural naming scheme.

## Certificate Layer Status

The certificate layer is abstract: it works over entropy atoms, rational
linear combinations of entropy atoms, and abstract Shannon entropy valuations.

Implemented and building:

- entropy atoms as finite sets of variables;
- sparse rational entropy expressions;
- explicit empty-entropy convention;
- abstract `ShannonEntropyVal`, packaging `H(empty) = 0`, conditional entropy
  nonnegativity, and conditional mutual information nonnegativity;
- primitive Shannon inequality expressions for empty entropy, conditional
  entropy, and conditional mutual information;
- soundness theorems for primitive inequalities under a
  `ShannonEntropyVal`;
- checked certificate structures with nonnegative rational coefficients;
- raw certificate data and a raw-to-checked validator;
- exact decomposition matching over normalized rational entropy expressions;
- soundness theorem: if raw data validates to a checked certificate, then the
  target entropy expression is nonnegative under every `ShannonEntropyVal`.

The current project has the checking/validation side, not automatic
certificate generation. Future PSITIP/oXitip-style integration should remain
untrusted: external tools can search for certificates and emit raw data, while
Lean validation remains the trusted step.

## Submodularity Certificate Demo Status

`LeanInfoTheory.Certificate.Submodularity` is the first non-toy checked
certificate demo.

It proves the abstract entropy submodularity inequality

```text
0 <= H(A) + H(B) - H(A union B) - H(A inter B)
```

for every `ShannonEntropyVal`, by validating a one-step certificate whose
primitive ingredient is

```text
I(A \ B ; B \ A | A inter B) >= 0.
```

The demo includes:

- the target entropy expression;
- the corresponding primitive conditional-mutual-information expression;
- set identities showing the expressions match;
- checked and raw certificate data;
- a theorem that the raw certificate validates;
- a final soundness theorem derived through the generic checker.

This is a real checked-certificate path, but it is still a small example. It
does not yet include independence, Markov, or functional-dependence
assumptions.

## Website Status

Website source lives under `home_page/`. The current website includes a
homepage dashboard, theorem highlights, submodularity demo, module guide,
development page, prior-art page, roadmap, generated module-level dependency
map, and generated declaration index.

The declaration index is source-derived and is not full Lean doc-gen. The
dependency map is module-level and is not theorem-level leanblueprint. Keep
website wording honest about what is proved, demoed, generated, planned, and
future work.

## Important Design Constraints

- Do not use `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, `opaque`, or `undefined` in Lean
  source.
- Keep root imports lightweight.
- Keep semantic bridge, entropy bounds, demos, and reference modules separately
  importable where appropriate.
- Prefer mathlib definitions and APIs over local replacements.
- Do not redefine probability theory locally.
- Do not change Lean theorem statements during website-only tasks.
- Keep certificate generation and certificate validation conceptually
  separated.
- Keep future external certificate importers untrusted; Lean validation is the
  trusted step.
- When upgrading mathlib, re-run the semantic bridge API audit and check
  whether mathlib has added canonical finite PMF product, finite KL expansion,
  or averaged conditional-KL APIs.

## Recommended Next Lean Tasks

1. Add more semantic theorem API around the current bridge layer:
   mutual-information symmetry, additional chain rules, conditional entropy
   chain rules, and conditioning-reduces-entropy.
2. Add more textbook entropy inequalities through the checked-certificate
   path, starting with small primitive-Shannon examples before larger network
   converse steps.
3. Exercise the raw-to-checked certificate validator on several examples before
   adding primitive-recognition/autotagging.
4. Design certificate extensions for independence, Markov constraints, and
   functional dependence, but only after the primitive-only checker has more
   theorem pressure.
5. Delay finite-family entropy until pair/triple APIs and semantic bridge
   proofs show the right representation.
6. Revisit whether `LeanInfoTheory.Shannon.InfoMeasures` should be split only
   when file size or theorem pressure makes boundaries clear.
7. Prepare small mathlib PR candidates for generic reusable PMF and finite
   measure lemmas once names and assumptions stabilize locally.
8. Later, add PSITIP/oXitip-style certificate import after the internal raw
   certificate format is stable.
