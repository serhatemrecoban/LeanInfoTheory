# Roadmap

This roadmap records planned technical milestones. The homepage, theorem
highlights, and module guide record what is implemented now.

## Now

- Project B Chunk 2 is complete. All 18 steps finished finite KL
  support/equality, uniform-reference identities,
  sharp alphabet- and support-cardinality entropy bounds, and ordinary finite
  independence predicates with their mathlib `IndepFun`, zero-MI, and pair-
  entropy equality bridges, plus positive-fiber zero MI and the cross-product
  definition of conditional independence. Zero conditional MI now exactly
  characterizes conditional independence, and the associated conditional-
  entropy equality cases are closed. The support-sensitive and non-absolutely-
  continuous examples are now separately importable. The API review retained
  the current simp/module boundaries and added only four additive-entropy
  compatibility aliases. The complete milestone build, generated-reference,
  website, and repository hygiene suites pass.
- Project B Chunk 3 is complete. All 20 steps of its revised finite-channel,
  Markov, and data-processing plan are finished. The opt-in
  `Probability.FiniteChannel` core now names the four repeated PMF channel
  constructions and proves their basic laws without changing the root or
  introducing heavier semantics. The new opt-in `SemanticBridge.Markov` module
  now defines the total conditional channel with its documented null-fiber
  fallback and proves its weighted atom and pair-law reconstruction laws. It
  also owns the PMF and random-variable Markov predicates, while the
  independence layer now supplies the required first-two-variable conditional-
  independence symmetry. Cross-product, positive-fiber, zero-CMI, and reversal
  characterizations are complete, and arbitrary pair laws extended through a
  channel on their second coordinate are now proved Markov. The exact identity
  `I(X;Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)`, MI data processing, its conditional-entropy
  consequence, and its reverse-Markov equality case are available at PMF and
  random-variable levels. One-sided, independently two-sided, cascade, and
  deterministic output-map channel corollaries are also complete. The canonical
  total-conditional-channel and existential channel-factorization converses are
  now proved. The Step 13 no-placeholder checkpoint selected a finite kernel-
  chain-rule route to KL contraction, validated its posterior reconstruction,
  and locked an unconditional `ENNReal` theorem plus a real corollary guarded
  only by input support inclusion. The new opt-in
  `SemanticBridge.DataProcessing` module now supplies `pmfChannelKernel`, its
  Markov-kernel instance, and the `channelJoint_toMeasure` bridge to mathlib's
  measure-kernel composition product. It also supplies `channelPosterior`, its
  PMF reconstruction law, and the exact `klDiv_channel_eq_add_posterior`
  identity. The resulting public API now supplies unconditional `ENNReal` and
  input-support-guarded real KL contraction through a common channel, together
  with deterministic-map and channel-cascade forms. One-step contraction toward
  invariant reference laws and entropy growth under uniform-preserving and
  finite doubly stochastic channels are now complete. The common-cause and
  stochastic-channel examples now exercise the new API, and the scheduled
  naming, simp, module, and future-work review is complete. The final milestone
  build, generated-reference, website, consumer, root-isolation, and repository-
  hygiene suites pass; the lightweight root remains unchanged.
- Future Work Note 29 is the next Project B mathematical planning anchor:
  sufficient-statistics and recovery-equality work comes first, followed by a
  separately planned Fano phase. No post-Chunk-3 theorem plan is active yet.
- Maintain project notes in the foundation conventions and project log.
- Keep the lightweight finite API separated from heavier KL and coding imports.

## 3 Months

- Publish a genuine leanblueprint web page, blueprint PDF, and theorem-level
  dependency graph.
- Upgrade the current source-derived declaration index into full Lean doc-gen
  output, while keeping the hand-written module guide as a stable
  orientation page.
- Link generated docs and blueprint entries back to the curated theorem
  highlights and submodularity demo page.
- Extend the Cover-Thomas Chapter 2 layer through a focused sufficient-
  statistics and recovery-equality phase, then plan Fano separately after that
  API is stable.

## 6 Months

- Add richer certificate constraints such as independence, functional
  dependence, and Markov constraints.
- Return to richer checked-certificate assumptions and recognizable converse
  steps after the planned Project B foundations are in place.
- Prepare focused mathlib PRs for generic finite-measure lemmas.

## 12 Months

- Add PSITIP/oXitip-style certificate import.
- Formalize selected converse proof skeletons.
- Write a technical report or short paper describing the Lean library and
  certificate pipeline.
- Stabilize project documentation, full Lean doc-gen output, and theorem-level
  blueprint dependency graph.
